========================================================AUTOMATION CONTROL========================================================

This app takes real time into consideration. The description says the following "When a motion is detected in one
of the sub corridors the corresponding lights need to be switched ON between 6 PM to 6 AM (Night Time slot)". Taking this
into consideration, if the app is run between 6 AM to 6 PM (Day Time slot), the lights in sub corridors
will be switched  OFF.

I have followed TDD and covered the major part of the code base. However I have not written test cases for all the classes
due to time constraints.


INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN
Running the following commands will generate result.out containing the output
1. To initialize the hotel (default state)
./gradlew test --tests  com.sahaj.automationControl.executor.ControllerImplTest.testInitialStateOfHotel
2. To test movement
./gradlew test --tests  com.sahaj.automationControl.executor.ControllerImplTest.testMovement
3. To test no movement
./gradlew test --tests  com.sahaj.automationControl.executor.ControllerImplTest.testNoMovement

I have added some more details in ControllerImplTest wrt providing inputs and writing more test cases if needed

NOTE: Running all the units tests together will be successful, but the result.out generated will contain the output of
all the unit tests. So run the commands above one by one and use result.out to check the corresponding output


TOOLS USED
1. Java
2. Gradle
3. JUnits for unit tests and also to test final output
